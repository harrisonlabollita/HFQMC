# HFQMC.jl

A Hirsch-Fye quantum monte carlo solver for dynamical mean-field theory calculations of the Hubbard model.

**Under construction**

Currently here is old DMFT code for the Bethe lattice using HFQMC as the impurity solver. The plan is to implement generic HFQMC solver for a class of Hubbard model problems.
